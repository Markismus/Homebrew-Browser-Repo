"Then gave I her, -- so tutor'd by my art, --
 A sleeping potion; which so took effect
 As I intended, for it wrought on her
 The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo
 That he should hither come as this dire night,
 To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
 Being the time the potion's force should cease."
    -William Shakespeare, _Romeo and Juliet_
