# portal.des: Definition of entries leading to portal vaults.
#
# These vaults are used when the dungeon builder tries to place a portal
# to a branch. There's no guarantee that one of these will be used because
# portal vaults are placed last, after the rest of the level is generated, and 
# will not be placed if they can't fit on the level without clobbering 
# something.
#
# With portal vaults (as with minivaults), smaller is better, since the dungeon
# builder will frequently not be able to fit large vaults in anywhere (it
# doesn't try very hard).
#
# Note that the rune symbol (O) is used for the portal in portal vaults. If you
# do not put an O anywhere in the vault, there will be no portal for that 
# branch!
