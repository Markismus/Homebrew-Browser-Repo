	<long_description>priiloader is a small application which places itself before the system menu.
It's main feature is to directly boot the Homebrew Channel or a file you can install from a FAT device.
priiloader is also able to apply memory patches the system menu to remove limitations or other things.
Since priiloader places itself before the system menu any problems that would cause the system menu to fail are not causing your whole wii 
to stop working.
If autoboot is enabled and you want to access priiloader's menu simply hold RESET while powering the wii on.
