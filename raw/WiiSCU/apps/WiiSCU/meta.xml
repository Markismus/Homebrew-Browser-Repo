		<long_description>Wii System Channels Updater "WiiSCU" is a modification of tona's IOS51&amp;Shop Installer to update your Wii's System Channels (and various IOSes) to the latest versions. Based on PatchMii by bushing.

This version fixes the stubbed bricking with IOS60, because it grabs the older version of IOS60. Modified by illinialex24, compiled by Bionic Sonic.
